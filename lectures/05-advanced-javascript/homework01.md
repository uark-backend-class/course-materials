We live in a future where we have the ability to build our own cars using JavaScript (hey - it could happen). Your task is to create a blueprint for a car, and then produce two cars from that blueprint. Your task:

  - Create a folder named `js-cars` from the command line
  - Initialize the `js-cars` folder as a git repository
  - Create a file named `blueprint.js` from the command line
    - In this file, create a car blueprint. Your car should have:
      - Between 0 - 6 wheels
      - A top speed
      - A color
      - A function to report how long this car would take to travel 1/4 mile at top speed
    - Within this same file, create two different versions of cars based on this blueprint
  - Commit and push all changes to a new GitHub repository from the command line
