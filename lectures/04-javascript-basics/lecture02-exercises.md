# Lecture 2 - JavaScript Basics - Exercises

## Exercise 1
- Create a variable, and assign it your name as a string value.
- Log the variable to the console
- Run the program via the command line

## Exercise 2

- Create unique primitive variables that comply with the following requirements:
  - A string
  - A number
  - A boolean
  - undefined
  - null

## Exercise 3
- Create a variable with your first name and a variable with your last name.
- Create a variable that concatenates the two name variables into your full name and log your full name to the console.

## Exercise 4 (Conditionals)
- Write a javascript file that contains two number variables.
- Write a conditional statement to compare the two variables and output the larger of the two variables to the console.

## Exercise 5 (Conditionals)
- Write a javascript file that contains a number variable for a year.
- Determine if the year is a leap year.
  - Leap years are divisible by four - except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400
- Log to the console the year followed by true if a leap year or false if it is not a leap year (e.g. "2000 true", "1900 false", "2016 true", "1992 true")

## Exercise 6 (Loops)
- Write a while loop to write 0 to 10 to the console.
- Write a for loop to write 0 to 10 to the console.

## Exercise 7 (Loops)
- Write a for loop to write even numbers 0 to 20 to the console.
- Write a for loop to write odd numbers 0 to 20 to the console.

## Exercise 8 (Loops)
- Do the looping a triangle exercise in Eloquent JavaScipt located at the end of the chapter [here](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html).

## Exercise 9 (Functions)
- Convert your JavaScript that calculates leap year into a function called isLeapYear. isLeapYear will take one parameter, the year, and return true if the year is a leap year. Otherwise, the function will return false.
