# Express Homework #1

* Create a new project directory
* Initialize this directory as a git repo
    * Make sure not to check in the `node_modules` directory into github
* Initialize a new NPM project in this directory
* Create a new Express application
    * This application should not be a single file, be sure to break routes into separate folders and files
* This Express application should implement several endpoints, at least **two** of each of the following.
    * GET
    * POST
    * PUT
* The route method (GET, PUT, POST) doesn't need to reflect the use-cases we discussed in class (CRUD database operations). As we haven't covered databases in lecture yet. This is just for practice creating different types of endpoints.
* We have already written several self-contained functions in our Javascript Basics section that will easily convert to the API format. Reference Section 4 Lectures 6 through 10 for example problems. Select any that you want from these previous examples.
* These routes should accept the function arguments as either query parameters or a post body and return the results of the function in the response.
* You should write tests for each of your routes using the tools we covered in lecture.
* I will try to be available on slack to answer any questions you may have.
