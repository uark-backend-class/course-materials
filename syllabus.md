# Course Description & Goals

- This course will walk you through back-end web application development using Node.js and MongoDB. JavaScript will be used throughout the course to teach how to create APIs. Discussions will also hit on how front-end web applications will utilize APIs in production scenarios.

- Upon completion of this course, you will be able to create a web API from scratch and deploy it to a cloud-based hosting provider. You will understand web architecture, including databases, and how web or mobile applications will interact with that API. You will also understand the role that developers play on an overall product team to prepare you for a transition into a work environment.
